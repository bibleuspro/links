  What technologies do you support?
We currently support only FreePDK45 and SCN3ME_SUBM for 0.5um n-well associated with MOSIS Scalable CMOS. This is mainly due to IP issues, but the compiler can be used with any technology. It has been successfully used and fabricated with IBM cmos32soi 32nm.<p>
  
  Does this support foundry bitcells?
 

Yes! You can replace any cell or module with a customized version. If you want to use a foundry bitcell, just replace it in your configuration file. In addition, you can use this to create customized decoders, sense amplifiers, etc.<p>
